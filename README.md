Submission for Week: 6
06 Weather Dashboard
My goals included:
Creating a functional weather Display using JavaScrip, Jquery, HTML, and CSS.  I attempted to design the code with the following he last searched city forecast

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast


This project was highly challenging and I struggled a lot with several things in the acceptance criteria . Although I attempted to write the code to pull the UV index , I was unsuccessful .  Among other challenges, I want toi include my understanding of presenting a 5 day forecast, and the search function for random cities.  Although I struggled , I do feel more confident with ajax calls and functions. Some of the things I waas able to execute include successfully linking my api for select cities that I have chosen. I was able to create a wireframe and make my page accordingly to include the temperature, wind speed and humidity within the cities.  Overall I would have like to have had more time in office hours to answer some questions but I gave this project 100% and pushed myself to complete as much of the project as possible
